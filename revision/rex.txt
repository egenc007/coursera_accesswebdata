To start this class out we cover the basics of 
Object Oriented Python. We won't be writing our own objects,
but since many of the things we use like BeautifulSoup, strings,
dictionaries, database connections all use Object Oriented (OO)
patterns we should at least understand some of its patterns and
terminology.
We learn the four core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, 
and Delete) to manage data stored in a database.
In this section we explore how to model situations like
students enrolling in courses where each course has many 
students and each student is enrolled in many courses.
